			<h1>Cement Industry</h1>
			<img src="images/cement.jpg">
			<h2>Cement Industries in Bangladesh </h2>
			<h3>Growth Drivers:</h3>
			<p>Massive infrastructure investment,<br>
			   Growth of Real Estate Sectors,<br>
			   Rising Inward Remittance,<br>
			   Increasing Personal Income,<br>
			   Huge Home Loan Interest Rate Cut for Govt.  Employees,Growing Urban Population.</p>
			   <h3>Challenges:</h3>
			   <p> Mounting Overcapacity,<br> Intense Competition among Industry Players,<br> Price Volatility of Imported Raw Materials,<br>Foreign Exchange Risk</p>
			   <h2>Cement Industry</h2>
			   <h3>What is cement:
</h3>
<p>Powdered materials
 have plastic flow while mixed with water<br>
 have property of settling<br>
 to hard solid structure with varying degree of strength
and bonding properties
</p>
<p>Portland cement:
Small amount water<br>
In few hours it would be hard like stone<br>
 Main raw materials: limestone, bauxite and clay<br>
Portland cement is a calcium alumina silicate compound and is
manufactured from limestone and clay (or shale) with minor
amounts of iron oxide, silica sand and alumina as additives where
required to balance the mineral composition.
</p>
<h2>Manufacture</h2>
<p>1. Wet process<br>
2. Dry process<br>
1. Wet process: Europe and Asia
 Limestone and clay are soft, moist weather and cheap fuel<br>
2. Dry process: USA
 Limestone and clay are hard and fuels are cheap
The process selection was depends on:
 Physical condition of raw materials
 Climate
 Cost of fuel
Dry process: A little low quality cement

<h1>Glass Industry</h1>
<img src="images/glass.jpg">
<h2>Physical properties of Glass</h2>
<p>1. Non-crystalline, often transparent amorphous solid<br>
2. Completely vitrified product<br>
3. Hard and rigid : no definite melting point<br>
4. High viscosity<br>
5. Insulator of electricity
</p>
<h3>Manufacture of Glass</h3>
<p>Formation of batch material<br>
Melting<br>
Shaping<br>
Annealing<br>
Finishing
</p>
<h2>Special Glasses</h2>
<h3>Fused silica glass</h3>
<p>- made by fused pure silica but not transparent<br>
- made by high temperature pyrolysis of silicon tetrachloride<br>
- used for telescope mirrors<br>
Properties :
- low specific gravity (2.07)<br>
- High softening point (1427
oC)<br>
- low coefficient of thermal expansion<br>
- Highest annealing point (1074
oC)<br>
- Unusual chemical stability
</p>
<h3>High silica glass</h3>
<p>- 96% SiO
2
and 3% B2O3
and
alumina<br>
- made from borosilicate glass
 heating: silica as separate layer
 HCl treatment at 98oC
 second heat treatment furnishes the glass<br>
- used in laboratory wares: condensers, crucibles etc.<br>
Properties :<br>
- low specific gravity (but > 2.07)<br>
- High softening point (1500
oC)<br>
- low thermal conductivity<br>
- High annealing point<br>
- High chemical stability<br>
- Transparent<br>
- high temperature fluctuation resistance
</p>
<h3>Optical glass</h3>
<p>- phosphorus and lead silicate with cerium oxide<br>
- Cerium oxide: absorb ultra violet light<br>
Properties :<br>
- High specific composition<br>
- low viscosity<br>
- long annealing<br>
- free from bubbles<br>
- sustain optical clarity
</p>
<h3>Lead glass</h3>
<p>- lead oxide + silica + alkali<br>
- 92% lead<br>
- used for optical work; electric bulbs, neon tubing etc.<br>
Properties :<br>
- High refractive index<br>
- Low hardness<br>
- High dispersion power<br>
- high density<br>
</p>
<h1>Ceramics Industry</h1>
<img src="images/ceramics.jpg">
<h3>What is ceramics?</h3>
<p> An inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or
carbide material:carbon or silicon (clay), may be considered
ceramics.<br>
 Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and
weak in shearing and tension
</p>
<h3>Use of ceramics</h3>
<p> Construction and decoration<br>
 Manufacture of metals (refractory materials)<br>
 Manufacture of chemical products (stoneware and porcelain)<br>
 Sanitation<br>
 Insulation in electrical industry
</p>
<h2>Ceramics Industry: Bangladesh aspect</h2>
<p>One of the exports oriented and fast growing sectors<br>
 Almost 80% of total demand is being met by local industries<br>
 Trade liberalization policy required:<br>
reduction of tariff rates<br>
simplification of tariff structure<br>
minimization of non-tariff barrier<br>
simplification of trade law
</p>
<h2>SWOT Analysis
Export & Growth Potential of Ceramic Industries in Bangladesh
</h2>
<p>Bangladesh’s ceramic has competitive advantage having low cost man power and
availability of gas, whereas interest for the capital and production capacity at an
international standard is still weakened the industry. It has opportunity to grow
further because of a substantial local and untapped international market for
export. To some extent the industry faces unlawful competition for cheap
import and also a great concern over health risk of ceramic tableware. Health
risk can be minimized through improvement of product quality but price remains
a threat to survive from import.
</p>
<h3>Ceramics Industry</h3>
<p>Types of ceramics according to main fields of use:<br>
Structural ceramics: building bricks, roof tiles etc<br>
Facing materials: facing bricks; oven tiles<br>
Refractories: Materials retain their mechanical properties at
1000oC<br>
Fine ceramics: domestically, electrically and laboratory<br>
Special ceramics: radio industry, aviation and special instrument
</p>
<h3>Subdivision of Ceramics
</h3>
<p>1. Heavy clay products: Mainly clay + small other materials;
roofing tiles, sewer pipes; stoneware etc.<br>
2. Pottery products: domestic product, electrical product etc.
Pottery products: four groups<br>
i. Terracotta:<br>
made from common clay<br>
porous pottery – not subject to high temperature<br>
not covered with glaze<br>
Common bricks, hollow wares etc
